                </h1>
          
                  <p>Non-cancerous brain tumours tend to stay in one place and do not spread. It will not usually come back if all of the tumour can be safely removed during surgery.

                     If the tumour cannot be completely removed, there's a risk it could grow back. In this case it'll be closely monitored using scans or treated with radiotherapy.</p>

                  <h2>Types and grades of non-cancerous brain tumour</h2>
                  <p>There are many different types of non-cancerous brain tumours, which are related to the type of brain cells affected.</p>
                  <h5>Examples include:</h5>

                  <h6>Gliomas:</h6>
                  <p>Tumours of the glial tissue, which hold and support nerve cells and fibres.</p>

                  <h6>Meningiomas:</h6>
                  <p>Tumours of the membranes that cover the brain.</p>

                  <h6>Acoustic Neuromas:</h6>
                  <p>Tumours of the acoustic nerve (also known as vestibular schwannomas).</p>

                  <h6>Craniopharyngiomas:</h6>
                  <p>Tumours near the base of the brain that are most often diagnosed in children, teenagers and young adults.</p>

                  <h6>Haemangioblastomas:</h6>
                  <p>Tumours of the brain's blood vessels.</p>

                  
                  <h6>Pituitary Adenomas:</h6>
                  <p>Tumours of the pituitary gland, a pea-sized gland on the under surface of the brain.</p>

              <p>
                     The Cancer Research UK website has more information about the different types of brain tumours.
              
                     Brain tumours are graded from 1 to 4 according to how fast they grow and spread, and how likely they are to grow
                     back after treatment.
              
                     Non-cancerous brain tumours are grades 1 or 2 because they tend to be slow growing and unlikely to spread.
              
                     They are not cancerous and can often be successfully treated, but they're still serious and can be life
                     threatening.
              </p>

                 <h2>Symptoms of non-cancerous brain tumours</h2>
                 <p>The symptoms of a non-cancerous brain tumour depend on how big it is and where it is in the brain. Some slow-growing tumours may not cause any symptoms at first.</p>

                 <p>Common symptoms include:</p>

                 <ul>
                     <li>new, persistent headaches</li>
                     <li>seizures (epileptic fits)</li>
                     <li>feeling sick all the time, being sick, and drowsiness</li>
                     <li>mental or behavioural changes, such as changes in personality</li>
                     <li>weakness or paralysis, vision problems, or speech problems</li>
                 </ul>
                
                 <h2>When to see a GP</h2>
              <p>See a GP if you have symptoms of a brain tumour. While it's unlikely to be a tumour, these symptoms need to be
                     assessed by a doctor.
              
                     The GP will examine you and ask about your symptoms. They may also test your nervous system.
              
                     If the GP thinks you may have a brain tumour, or they're not sure what's causing your symptoms, they'll refer you
                     to a brain and nerve specialist called a neurologist.
              </p>
             
              <h2>Causes of non-cancerous brain tumours</h2>
              <p>The cause of most non-cancerous brain tumours is unknown, but you're more likely to develop one if:</p>

              <ul>
                     <li>you're over the age of 50</li>
                     <li>you have a family history of brain tumours</li>
                     <li>you have a genetic condition that increases your risk of developing a non-cancerous brain tumour such as neurofibromatosis type 1, neurofibromatosis type 2, tuberous sclerosis, Turcot syndrome, Li-Fraumeni cancer syndrome, von Hippel-Lindau syndrome, and Gorlin syndrome</li>

                     <li>you've had radiotherapy</li>
              </ul>

              <h2>Treating non-cancerous brain tumours</h2>
              <p>Treatment for a non-cancerous brain tumour depends on the type and location of the tumour.
              
                     Surgery is used to remove most non-cancerous brain tumours, and they do not usually come back after being
                     removed. But sometimes tumours do grow back or become cancerous.
              
                     If all of the tumour cannot be removed, other treatments, such as radiotherapy and chemotherapy, may be needed to
                     control the growth of the remaining abnormal cells.
              </p>

              <h2>Recovering from treatment for a non-cancerous brain tumour</h2>
              <p>After treatment, you may have persistent problems, such as seizures and difficulties with speech and walking. You may need supportive treatment to help you recover from, or adapt to, these problems.

                     Many people are eventually able to resume their normal activities, including work and sport, but it can take time.
                     
                     You may find it useful to speak to a counsellor if you want to talk about the emotional aspects of your diagnosis and treatment.</p>

               <h1><i> Symptoms</i></h1>
               <p>
                    <b>The symptoms of a benign (non-cancerous) brain tumour depend on its size and where it is in the brain.</b> 
                     
                     Some slow-growing tumours may not cause any symptoms at first. When symptoms occur, it's because the tumour is putting
                     pressure on the brain and preventing a specific area of the brain from working properly
               </p>

               <h2>Increased pressure on the brain</h2>
               <p>Common symptoms of increased pressure within the skull include:</p>
               <ul>
                     <li>new, persistent headaches â€“ which are sometimes worse in the morning or when bending over or coughing</li>
                     <li>feeling sick all the time</li>
                     <li>drowsiness</li>
                     <li>drowsiness
                            vision problems â€“ such as blurred vision, double vision, loss of part of the visual field (hemianopia), and temporary vision loss</li>
                            <li>epileptic fits (seizures) â€“ which may affect the whole body, or you may just have a twitch in one area</li>
               </ul>

               <h2>Location of the tumour</h2>
               <p>Different areas of the brain control different functions, so the symptoms of a brain tumour will depend on where it's located.</p>
               <p>For example, a tumour affecting the:</p>

               <ul>
                     <li>frontal lobe â€“ may cause changes in personality, weakness in one side of the body, and loss of smell.</li>
                     <li>temporal lobe â€“ may cause memory loss (amnesia) language problems (aphasia), and seizures.</li>
                     <li>parietal lobe â€“ may cause aphasia, numbness or weakness in one side of the body, and co-ordination problems (dyspraxia), such as difficulty dressing.</li>
                     <li>occipital lobe â€“ may cause loss of vision on one side of the visual field (hemianopia).</li>
                     <li>cerebellum â€“ may cause balance problems (ataxia), flickering of the eyes (nystagmus), and vomiting.</li>
                     <li>brain stem â€“ may cause unsteadiness and difficulty walking, facial weakness, double vision, and difficulty speaking (dysarthria) and swallowing (dysphagia).</li>
               </ul>

               <h2>When to see a GP</h2>
              <p>It's important to see a GP if you have any symptoms.
              
                     While it's unlikely that you have a tumour, these type of symptoms need to be evaluated by a doctor so the cause
                     can be identified.
              
                     If the GP is unable to find a more likely cause of your symptoms, they may refer you to a brain and nerve
                     specialist called a neurologist for further assessment and tests, such as a brain scan.

                     If they suspect you may have a tumour or are not sure what's causing your symptoms, they may refer you to
                     a brain and nerve specialist (a neurologist) for further investigation.

                            Benign (non-cancerous) brain tumours can usually be successfully removed with surgery and do not usually grow back.</b>
                            
                            <p>
                            It often depends on whether the surgeon is able to safely remove all of the tumour.
                            
                            If there's some left, it can either be monitored with scans or treated with radiotherapy.
                            
                            Rarely, some slow-growing non-cancerous tumours grow back after treatment and can change into malignant brain tumour
                            (brain cancer), which are fast growing and likely to spread.
                            
                            You'll usually have follow-up appointments after finishing your treatment to monitor your condition and look for signs
                            of the tumour returning.
                     </p>
                     </p>
                     <h2>Surgery</h2>
                     <p>
                            Surgery is the main treatment for non-cancerous brain tumours. The aim is to remove as much of the tumour as safely as possible without damaging the surrounding brain tissue.

                            In most cases, a procedure called a craniotomy will be performed. Most operations are carried out under a general anaesthetic, which means you'll be asleep during the procedure.
                            
                            But in some cases you may need to be awake and responsive, in which case a local anaesthetic will be used.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                            An area of your scalp will be shaved and a section of skull cut out as a flap to reveal the brain and tumour underneath.
                            
                            The surgeon will remove the tumour and fix the bone flap back into place with metal screws. The skin is closed with
                            either sutures or staples.
                            
                            If it is not possible to remove the entire tumour, you may need further treatment with chemotherapy or radiotherapy.
                            
                            The Cancer Research UK website has more information about brain tumour surgery.
                     </p>
              
              <h2>Radiosurgery</h2>
              <p>Some tumours are located deep inside the brain and are difficult to remove without damaging surrounding tissue. In these cases, a special type of radiotherapy called stereotactic radiosurgery may be used.

                     During radiosurgery, tiny beams of high-energy radiation are focused on the tumour to kill the abnormal cells.
                     
                     Treatment consists of one session, recovery is quick, and you can usually go home on the same day.
                     
                     Radiosurgery is only available in a few specialised centres in the UK. It's only suitable for some people, based on the characteristics, locations and size of their tumour.</p>
              
                     <h2>Chemotherapy and Radiotherapy</h2>
                     <p>Conventional chemotherapy is occasionally used to shrink non-cancerous brain tumours or kill any cells left behind after surgery. 

                            Radiotherapy involves using controlled doses of high-energy radiation, usually X-rays, to kill the tumour cells.
                            
                            Chemotherapy is less frequently used to treat non-cancerous brain tumours. It's a powerful medicine that kills tumour cells, and can be given as a tablet, injection or drip.
                            
                            Side effects of these treatments can include tiredness, hair loss, nausea, and reddening of your skin.</p>

                     
                     <h2>Medicine to treat symptoms</h2>
                     <p>You may also be given medicine to help treat some of your symptoms before or after surgery, including:</p>

                     <ul>
                            <li>anticonvulsants to prevent epileptic fits (seizures)</li>
                            <li>steroids to reduce swelling around the tumour, which can relieve some of your symptoms and make surgery easier</li>
                            <li>painkillers to treat headaches</li>
                            <li>anti-emetics to prevent vomiting</li>
                     </ul>

                     <p><b>After being treated for a benign (non-cancerous) brain tumour, you may need additional care to monitor and treat any further problems. And you have to take care the following things</b></p>
                     <ul>
                            <li><b>Follow-up appointments</b>
                            <p>Non-cancerous brain tumours can sometimes grow back after treatment, so you'll have regular follow-up appointments to check for signs of this.</p>
                            </li>

                            <li><b>Driving and travelling</b>
                                   <p>You may not be allowed to drive for a while after being diagnosed with a brain tumour.</p>
                            </li>

                            <li><b>Lifestyle advice</b>
                            <p>
                                   If you have had radiotherapy, it's important to follow a healthy lifestyle to lower your risk of stroke.
                                   
                                   This means stopping smoking if you smoke, eating a balanced diet and doing regular exercise.
                                   
                                   However, there are limits to the exercise you should do.

                            <li><b>Sports and activities</b>
                            <p>After being treated for a brain tumour, you might be advised to permanently avoid contact sports, such as rugby and
                            boxing.
                            
                            You can start other activities again, with the agreement of your doctor, once you have recovered.</p>
                            </li>

                            <li><b>Sex and pregnancy</b>
                            <p>It's safe to have sex after treatment for a non-cancerous brain tumour.
                            
                            Women may be advised to avoid becoming pregnant for 6 months or more after treatment.
                            
                            If you're planning to become pregnant, you should discuss this with your medical team.
                            </p>

                            <li><b>Going back to work</b>
                            <p>Tiredness is a common symptom after receiving treatment for a brain tumour. This often restricts your ability to return to work.

                                   Although you may want to return to work and normal life as soon as possible, it's probably a good idea to work part time to begin with and only go back full time when you feel ready.
                                   
                                   If you have had seizures, you should not work with machinery or at heights.</p>
