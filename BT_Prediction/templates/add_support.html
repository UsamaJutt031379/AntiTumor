              Where to get help for drugs
           </h1>
           <p>A GP is a good place to start. They can discuss your problems with you and get you into treatment.

              They may offer you treatment at the practice or refer you to your local drug service.</p>
              <p>If you're not comfortable talking to a GP, you can approach your local drug treatment service yourself.

                     Visit the Frank website to find local drug treatment services.
                     
                     If you're having trouble finding the right sort of help, call the Frank drugs helpline on 0300 123 6600. They can talk you through all your options.</p>
