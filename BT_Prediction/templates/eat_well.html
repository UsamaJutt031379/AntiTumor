           <p>This means eating a wide variety of foods in the right proportions, and consuming the right amount of food and drink to achieve and maintain a healthy body weight.</p>
           <p>This page covers healthy eating advice for the general population.

              People with special dietary needs or a medical condition should ask their doctor or a registered dietitian for advice.</p>


           <h1 class="pb-4 mb-4 fst-italic border-bottom">
              Food groups in your diet
           </h1>
           <p>The Eatwell Guide shows that to have a healthy, balanced diet, people should try to::</p>
   
           <ul>
             <li>eat at least 5 portions of a variety of fruit and vegetables every day (see 5 A Day)</li>
             <li>base meals on higher fibre starchy foods like potatoes, bread, rice or pasta</li>
             <li>have some dairy or dairy alternatives (such as soya drinks)</li>
             <li>eat some beans, pulses, fish, eggs, meat and other protein</li>
             <li>choose unsaturated oils and spreads, and eat them in small amounts</li>
             <li>drink plenty of fluids (at least 6 to 8 glasses a day)</li>
           </ul>

           <p>If you're having foods and drinks that are high in fat, salt and sugar, have these less often and in small amounts.

              Try to choose a variety of different foods from the 5 main food groups to get a wide range of nutrients.</p>

              <p>Most people in the Pakistan eat and drink too many calories, too much saturated fat, sugar and salt, and not enough fruit, vegetables, oily fish or fibre.

                     The Eatwell Guide does not apply to children under the age of 2 because they have different nutritional needs.
                     
                     Between the ages of 2 and 5 years, children should gradually move to eating the same foods as the rest of the family in the proportions shown in the Eatwell Guide.</p>
   
       

           <h1 class="pb-4 mb-4 fst-italic border-bottom">
              Starchy foods in your diet
           </h1>
   
           <p>Starchy foods should make up just over a third of everything you eat. This means your meals should be based on these foods.

              Choose wholegrain or wholemeal varieties of starchy foods, such as brown rice, wholewheat pasta, and brown, wholemeal or higher fibre white bread.</p>
   
           <p>They contain more fibre, and usually more vitamins and minerals, than white varieties.

              Potatoes with the skins on are a great source of fibre and vitamins. For example, when having boiled potatoes or a jacket potato, eat the skin too.</p>

       
           <h1 class="pb-4 mb-4 fst-italic border-bottom">
              Milk and dairy foods (and alternatives)
           </h1>
           <p>Milk and dairy foods, such as cheese and yoghurt, are good sources of protein. They also contain calcium, which helps keep your bones healthy.

              Go for lower fat and lower sugar products where possible.</p>
              <p>Choose semi-skimmed, 1% fat or skimmed milk, as well as lower fat hard cheeses or cottage cheese, and lower fat, lower sugar yoghurt.

                     Dairy alternatives, such as soya drinks, are also included in this food group.
                     
                     When buying alternatives, choose unsweetened, calcium-fortified versions.</p>


           <h1 class="pb-4 mb-4 fst-italic border-bottom">
              Beans, pulses, fish, eggs, meat and other proteins
           </h1>
           <p>These foods are all good sources of protein, which is essential for the body to grow and repair itself.

              They're also good sources of a range of vitamins and minerals.</p>
           <p>Meat is a good source of protein, vitamins and minerals, including iron, zinc and B vitamins. It's also one of the main sources of vitamin B12.

              Choose lean cuts of meat and skinless poultry whenever possible to cut down on fat. Always cook meat thoroughly.</p>
              <p>Eggs and fish are also good sources of protein, and contain many vitamins and minerals. Oily fish is particularly rich in omega-3 fatty acids.

                     Aim to eat at least 2 portions of fish a week, including 1 portion of oily fish.</p>
                     <p>You can choose from fresh, frozen or canned, but remember that canned and smoked fish can often be high in salt.

                            Pulses, including beans, peas and lentils, are naturally very low in fat and high in fibre, protein, vitamins and minerals.
                            
                            Nuts are high in fibre, and unsalted nuts make a good snack. But they do still contain high levels of fat, so eat them in moderation.</p>
